# .Net Core API Client

C\# .Net Core library to help with accessing the Sparks API.

## Installation & Usage

### Accessing NUGET Package

In order to access Logicdrop.Sparks.OpenApi, you must add a `nuget.config` file into the root of your project. This file will tell the `nuget cli` where to check for the package. An example of this files contents,

```markup
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<configuration>
    <config>
        <add key="repositoryPath" value="packages/" />
    </config>
    <packageSources>
        <add key="Logicdrop" value="https://depot.logicdrop.com/repository/nuget-public" />
    </packageSources>
</configuration>
```

In the above XML we tell NUGET that we want to manage our packages inside `packages/`. We also added another source to NUGET to point to the private Logicpdrop repository.

### Installing the Package

To install the package locally, run the following command inside your project directory,

```text
 nuget install Logicdrop.Sparks.OpenApi -Version 4.8.0
```

If this command was ran in the same folder as your `nuget.config` the required packages will be downloaded in you `repositoryPath` mentioned in the file.

### Linking Package to Project

To use the package inside you project, you will need to add a reference to the package inside your `.csproj` file. An example of what this file can look like is shown below,

```markup
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">

  <PropertyGroup>
    <OutputType>Exe</OutputType>
    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.2</TargetFramework>
  </PropertyGroup>

  <ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="Logicdrop.Sparks.OpenApi" version="4.8.0" />
  </ItemGroup>

</Project>
```

Once the reference has been added, you must run, `dotnet restore` to properly link the package to your project.

### Getting Started

Here is a basic `Program.cs` file that implements a call from thr Project Service,

```csharp
 using System;
using Logicdrop.Sparks.OpenApi.Api;
using Logicdrop.Sparks.OpenApi.Client;

namespace sample
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Configuration configuration = new Configuration("CLIENT_ID", "CLIENT_SECRET");

            ProjectServicesApi projectService = new ProjectServicesApi(configuration);

            string client = "CLIENT_NAME";

            try {
                var result = projectService.ListProjects(client);

                // Do something with the API result
            }
            catch(Exception ex) {
                // Do something with the error that was thrown
            } 
        }
    }
}
```
