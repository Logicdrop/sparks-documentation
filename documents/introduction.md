# Introduction to Sparks Documents

![](../.gitbook/assets/lexiconicon128.png)

## What is Sparks Documents?

Sparks Documents is an enterprise document publishing and automation system targeted at medium-to-large enterprises to address the problem of generating customized documents according to complex rules. This software dramatically shortens the time required to generate documents which require unique customization, including contracts, commercial lending documents, and correspondence. Our solution reduces risk, ensures compliance to institutional and government rules and encourages the collection of business knowledge in one place \(instead of disbursed in human capital and varying forms of documentation.\)

## How does it work?

Sparks Documents achieves this through the use of smart templates with embedded business rules which are testable, auditable, and versonable. Users maintain this logic themselves using a simple, drag-and-drop interface. The backend component is able to be hosted in the cloud or on-premise, and the front end components include a full-featured desktop application \(Windows\), web dashboard, and a Microsoft Word extension.

## Why does it matter?

Customers have seen a large ROI by greatly reducing the time required to generate a document by using a fixed-cost, transactional approach. Traditionally, this is performed manually using a combination of templates and historic documents, leading to errors and compliance issues. Customers have also dramatically reduced the time necessary to create and test a new document template \(to days from weeks or even months\) and detected errors.

## What are our advantages?

Sparks Documents differs from the competition in several key aspects:

* Sparks Documents Templates are able to convey a greater amount of automated customization of the document than any other solution known on the market. While all document automation systems allow inserting custom text \(similar to the mail merge function in most word processors\) a Logicdrop Template can automate virtually any setting including all font, color, list and paragraph style settings, changing those settings dynamically based on rules set by the user.
* A Sparks Documents Template compiles to a set of document assembly instructions. This is a fundamentally different approach than other document automation systems take, making it difficult or impossible to recreate some of the capabilities of our system without a complete rewrite of their systems. To protect this intellectual property, we plan on pursuing patents.
* A Sparks Documents Document is “Turing Complete” - a computer science term meaning that given sufficient space and time any combination of logic can be represented, no matter the complexity.
* Our use of a graphical drag-and-drop logic editor is much more advanced than the cryptic and error prone field tags used in other systems.
* Logicdrop Templates can be imported into Microsoft Word as a working draft, where specific customizations may be made to the document while it remains linked to live data. Using this process, updated portions of the document caused by a change in the underlying data may be automatically merged in with any custom changes made by the user.
