# Logicdrop Sparks Overview

### Introduction to the Sparks Platform 

Logicdrop Sparks is a platform and open API for rapidly building data analytics, automation, and dynamic content solutions. 

Sparks provides a suite of powerful, reusable, production-ready components that can be assembled to solve a variety of use cases with little to no code. Building with Sparks is a great way for companies to introduce themselves to automation without the considerable investment and risk in building a technology stack from the ground up. Proven use cases for Sparks include delivering learned insights from existing data, dynamic assembly of complex documents, content automation, and IoT applications. 

### How it Works

Sparks is hosted completely in the cloud on scalable infrastructure, with an option for on-premise deployments using Docker containers. The service is comprised of many micro-services which can be subscribed to separately or composed together to form powerful solutions to complex problems. From augmenting existing business systems to providing the entire back-end infrastructure for a rapid prototype, Sparks delivers. 

### The Benefits

* **Time-to-market:** Reduce the time-to-market for new automation and dynamic content solutions dramatically by composing Sparks services together to solve complex use cases which would take months or even years to develop. 
* **Zero dev-ops:** Instantly stage and clone rule containers, control the scale, and monitor performance metrics from a single dashboard. This saves countless hours and dedicated human resources. 
* **Simplicity:** Define business rules using familiar tools like Microsoft Excel, and deploy rule containers with an easy file upload. 
* **Extensibility:** Our modular platform design allows easy integration with existing business processes and applications. Our comprehensive developer API allows applications to invoke any Sparks feature directly for seamless integration.
