# Welcome

The Logicdrop Sparks Platform is the culmination of almost a decade of providing cutting-edge rules, data, and document based solutions to Fortune 1000 companies in financial, insurance, health care, and manufacturing industries.

We have experienced first-hand the benefits of business rule solutions through implementations for our clients. We also quickly recognized the complexities and cost involved in setting up the environments, developing and testing the solutions, and maintaining them afterwards. The projects were costly and the delivery cycles were long.

Sparks was created to solve this problem by providing a subscription-based API enablement platform that makes building intelligent solutions available to everyone.

We've put together lots of helpful guides to get you going. If you would like to jump right in, we recommend getting started with the 5-minute quick-start.
