# Introduction to the Logicdrop Sparks Platform

The Logicdrop Sparks Platform is the culmination of almost a decade of providing cutting-edge rules, data, and document based solutions to Fortune 1000 companies in financial, insurance, health care, and manufacturing industries.

We have experienced first-hand the benefits of business rule solutions through implementations for our clients. We also quickly recognized the complexities and cost involved in setting up the environments, developing and testing the solutions, and maintaining them afterwards. The projects were costly and the delivery cycles were long.

Sparks was created to solve this problem by providing a subscription-based API enablement platform that makes building intelligent solutions available to everyone.

### **With the Sparks Platform you can:**

* Reduce total cost of ownership \(TCO\). There are no complicated environments for you to install or maintain.
* Minimize the need for highly specialized technical resources.
* Reduce errors and time spent in manual processes.
* Validate and gain insights from your data, using business rules, faster and more reliably.
* Integrate with applications or external systems using our rich API. Our modular platform design allows easy integration with your existing business processes and applications.
* Reduce the time-to-market for new automation and dynamic content solutions dramatically by composing Sparks services together to solve complex use cases which would take months or even years to develop. 

### Real World Uses

Our clients use the Logicdrop Sparks Platform in a variety of ways, primarily for its rules engine and data functionality. Here are three of the most common uses we see:

#### Cloud-based Rules Engine

Sparks has been applied successfully in intricate vehicle simulations, health care metrics, and urban planning. By streamlining the process and allowing business analysts or engineers to create and manage their own rules, it has reduced the overall time needed to reach conclusions from months to hours or even minutes in some cases. Additionally, Sparks has lowered the learning curve to producing results and lets industries react quicker to changing requirements, thus achieving faster time-to-market and giving our clients a competitive edge.

#### Complex Document Automation

Banks, insurance agencies, and large law firms have discovered considerable cost-savings in automating their processes using Sparks. Rules are being used to analyze and manipulate complex financial and legal data. Our document services then generate precision legal documents from the results. Sparks has transformed these industries to adopt more transactional processes and saved considerable amounts of time and money.

#### Data Analytics and Transformation

 A wide variety of clients, mostly manufacturing, use the Sparks Platform to transform data. Our rules and data services have allowed companies to migrate from tedious, manually maintained spreadsheets to highly dynamic business intelligence dashboards. Furthermore, It has enabled them to quickly gain reliable insights from the vast amount of data they already have.

### How it Works

Logicdrop Sparks provides a suite of powerful, reusable, production-ready components that can be assembled to solve a variety of use cases with little to no code. Building with Sparks is a great way for companies to introduce themselves to automation without the considerable investment and risk in building a technology stack from the ground up. Proven use cases for Sparks include delivering learned insights from existing data, dynamic assembly of complex documents, content automation, and IoT applications. 

The Sparks Platform is hosted completely in the cloud on scalable infrastructure using kubernetes, with an option for on-premise deployments for enterprise subscribers. The service is comprised of many micro-services which may be composed together to form powerful solutions to complex problems. From augmenting existing business systems to providing the entire back-end infrastructure for a rapid prototype, Sparks delivers. 

Sparks is not meant to be a replacement for conventional applications, instead it is best applied as an API for other systems to interact with; and, through the Sparks portal, enables business users to manipulate data, rules, and document templates directly and without the need for software developers.
