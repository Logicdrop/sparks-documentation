# Working with Projects



## Creating a project

Projects may be created empty, as a blank project, or created from a template. We have a growing number of helpful template projects with are useful for learning and as convenient starting points.  


To create a new project, simply navigate to the Sparks Portal home screen and click **New Project.**

Simply select a new blank or template project, and provide a name or the new project. Optionally, tags may be specified for a blank project. These tags are user-controlled and can be used to identify the domain of a project, environments, and more.

{% hint style="info" %}
A permanent URL will be generated from your project name for access in the API. For example, "My Project" will become `my-project`. Generally, this permanent URL may not be changed, so ensure that projects are created using good naming conventions.
{% endhint %}

After the project has been created it will appear in the list of active projects.

## Opening a project

To open a project, simply click it's name for the project list screen. Alternatively, the project menu in the top navigation bar can be used to quickly switch between different projects.

After a project has been opened, its the project home page is presented. From here the user may update the project description \(a useful wiki-like area for in-depth description of the project's purpose and structure\) or jump to one of the various workspaces in the project.

Each workspace exposes specific functionality to manage what we refer to as artifacts. Artifact is a generic term that defines the type of item managed within its own work space \(i.e. Rulesets manages rules, Datasets manages data, etc.\).

The current workspaces available in a project are:

* **Datasets** for manipulating data
* **Rulesets** for designing and debugging rules
* **Assets** for supplementary resources like files, documents, images, etc.

## Managing projects

To manage the details of a project, or remove it, simply use the actions menu. Editable details include the friendly name for the project and tags.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Be cautious when removing a project, as the operation may not be undone and any containing rules and data will be deleted.
{% endhint %}
