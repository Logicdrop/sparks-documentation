# Decision Tables

If there are a lot of rules that only vary by the data and not the conditions the Excel-based \(xlsx\) decision table may be a good way to manage them.

Using a decision table you can automate rule generation for any number of rules reliably and update those rules when the spreadsheet template \(new condition, new consequence, new sheets, etc.\) or data in changes. This reduces the number of rules you have to write manually. 

Users familiar with Excel will find decision tables a simple and easy way to maintain and update rules in the Sparks Platform.

Decision tables can be imported by clicking on the **Import Decision Table** button. Whenever additional changes are made to your Excel file, it can then be re-imported using the same button.

For directions and examples of decision tables, please see the following guide:
