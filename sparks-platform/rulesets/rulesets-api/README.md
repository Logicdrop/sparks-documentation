# Rulesets API

Everything in the Sparks Platform is exposed through a richly defined API based on the latest OpenAPI \(fka Swagger\) specification. You can either access the API directly via RESTful calls or download one of our generated clients. We currently offer clients for Java, Spring, Python, Node.js, and Angular.

Most clients use the Sparks Platform to let users manage and manipulate rules and data easily and then integrate directly through the API from their external systems.

You can view our full API documentation at [https://docs.logicdrop.io](https://docs.logicdrop.io/).
