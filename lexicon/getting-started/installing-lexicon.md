The Lexicon client application may be installed via the installation media provided or from the above link. The desktop authoring environment requires Windows 8 or higher and .NET framework 4.6. Because the application communicates with an internet server, an internet \(or company intranet if installed on premise\) connection is also required.

{% hint style="info" %}
Updates to the Lexicon client application may be installed automatically. Whenever a new update is released, users will see an option to download and install the update the new software version. Note that sufficient account privileges are required to use the automatic update feature.
